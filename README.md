## Continuous Integration Builds

| CI Server | OS      | Status | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Jenkins   | Linux   | [![Build Status](https://junit.ci.cloudbees.com/job/JUnit5/badge/icon)](https://junit.ci.cloudbees.com/job/JUnit5) | Official CI build server for JUnit 5 |
| Travis CI | Linux   | [![Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/junit-team/junit5.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/junit-team/junit5) | Used to perform quick checks on submitted pull requests and for build matrices including JDK 8 and JDK 9 early access builds |
| AppVeyor  | Windows | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xv8wc8w9sr44ghc4/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/marcphilipp/junit5/branch/master) | Used to ensure that JUnit 5 can be built on Windows |

## Code Coverage

Code coverage using [Clover] for the latest build is available on the [Jenkins CI server].
We are thankful to [Atlassian] for providing the Clover license free of charge.

A code coverage report can also be generated locally by executing
`gradlew -PenableClover clean cloverHtmlReport` if you have a local Clover license file
on your computer. The results will be available in
`junit-tests/build/reports/clover/html/index.html`.

## Gradle Build Scans

JUnit 5 utilizes [Gradle's](https://gradle.com/) support for _Build Scans_. An example
build scan for JUnit 5 can be viewed [here](https://scans.gradle.com/s/pgjgssca2kkli).
Note, however, that the number of listed tests only reflects the Spock tests within the
JUnit 5 test suite. To see a full representation of the number of tests executed per
project, click on "See console output" on the build scan page.

## Building from Source

All modules can be built with Gradle using the following command.

```
gradlew clean assemble
```

All modules can be tested with Gradle using the following command.

```
gradlew clean test
```

Since Gradle has excellent incremental build support, you can usually omit executing the `clean` task.

## Installing in Local Maven Repository

All modules can be installed in a local Maven repository for consumption in other projects via the following command.

```
gradlew clean install
```
